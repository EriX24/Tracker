# Tracker
This programme is made by EriX24.

The controls are:
 - W: up
 - A: left
 - S: down
 - D: right
 - E: fire
 - Q: launch the mega projectile
 - SPACEBAR: abort the mission

Bugs:
 - If you spam E and move the projectile will bugout (They will spread for some reason)
 - The error is the same for spamming Q
 - If you spam too fast the display for the number of projectile will overlap
 - If CAPS LOCK is on the "aim" will not move (I think this is because the system thinks that CAPS are different from lower.)
 - The CAPS LOCK error goes for the E and Q as well

Info:
 - I added alot of notes in the code
 - There are no TODOs in main.py
 - I know the way to detect for aborting a mission for the projectiles is...bad

Thing to mention:
 - I used turtle to make it

Credits:
 - The background picture is by "ArtStation"
 - The "abort" image is made with "Pixilart"
 - The sounds are from Pixabay (The boom and the ping) (I forgot the authors)
 - The alarm sound is from Mixkit
