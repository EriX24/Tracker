This programme is made by EriX24.

The controls are:
 - W: up
 - A: left
 - S: down
 - D: right
 - E: fire
 - Q: ??? (OK. Fine it means to launch the mega projectile)
 - SPACEBAR: abort the mission

Bugs:
 - If you spam E and move the projectile will bugout (They will spread for some reason)
 - The error is the same for spamming Q
 - If you spam too fast the display for the number of projectile will overlap
 - If CAPS LOCK is on the "aim" will not move (I think this is because the system thinks that CAPS are different from lower.)
 - The CAPS LOCK error goes for the E and Q as well

Info:
 - I added alot of notes in the code
 - Please don't look in the secrets.py it is just for fun. It does not have API keys or stuff like that
 - There are no TODOs in main.py
 - I know the way to detect for aborting a mission for the projectiles is...bad

Thing to mention:
 - It says "YongbinFan Debugged main.py" but it's a error to do with my stuff...just ignore it please!
 - This is just for fun! :D
 - This took a while to make!
 - I used turtle to make it
 - Next I'm making a Bitcoin like thing!!!

C u later!!! (See you later!!!)
